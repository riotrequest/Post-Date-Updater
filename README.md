## Post Date Updater Plugin for WordPress

The Post Date Updater plugin for WordPress allows you to update the dates and times of your posts in bulk. With this plugin, you can modify the publication dates of your most recent posts, starting from the current date and moving backwards based on the number of posts you specify. The plugin offers customizable settings such as an initial days offset and a specific time range for randomizing the post times, making it flexible for various use cases.

### Example

If you set the number of posts to update to 100 on 06/30/2023, the plugin will update the latest post to 06/30/2023, the next to 06/29/2023, then 06/28/2023, and so on, adjusting the time for each post randomly within your specified range.
